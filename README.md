## About

This site presents a curated overview of my work as a **Fullstack JavaScript Engineer** with a frontend focus. It is engineered to be fast, accessible, and trivial to maintain - content lives in a single source of truth, assets are centralized through a manifest, and the production build is optimized for static hosting.

```

## Managing Assets

All images resolve through one entry point: [src/assets/images/index.js](src/assets/images/index.js). Placeholders currently reference Unsplash URLs.

To replace placeholders with local files:

1. Drop the asset into the appropriate folder (`projects/` or `awards/`).
2. Update the manifest at [src/assets/images/index.js](src/assets/images/index.js):

   ```js
   import talentics from './projects/talentics.jpg';
   import topLeader from './awards/top-leader-olf.jpg';

   export const projectImages = {
     talentics,
     // ...
   };

   export const awardImages = {
     topLeaderOlf: topLeader,
     // ...
   };
   ```

3. No changes are required in [src/Portofolio.jsx](src/Portofolio.jsx) - Vite will hash, optimize, and bundle the assets automatically.

### Available Image Keys

| Category | Key | Used For |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Project | `talentics` | Sekolah.mu / talentics.id |
| Project | `fifgroup` | FIFGROUP (ASTRA) |
| Project | `shiftacademy` | Peopleshift / shiftacademy.id |
| Project | `bigio` | PT Bejana Investidata (BIGIO.ID) |
| Project | `emApps` | EM Apps - Universitas Brawijaya |
| Award | `topLeaderOlf` | Top 50 Leader - OLF |

| Award | `teknologiInovasi` | 2nd Place - Teknologi Inovasi |
| Award | `bmcJatimOpen` | 1st Place - BMC Jatim Open 2023 |

---

## Updating Content

All portfolio data lives in well-named arrays inside [src/Portofolio.jsx](src/Portofolio.jsx):

| Array | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `navItems` | Top navigation items |
| `experiences` | Work history & related projects |
| `education` | Education history |
| `skills` | Grouped technical expertise |
| `awards` | Awards & leadership achievements |

Edit these arrays to update content - JSX markup below them does not need to be modified.

---

## Deployment

The site deploys automatically to **GitHub Pages** through the workflow at [.github/workflows/static.yml](.github/workflows/static.yml) on every push to `main`.

The `base` path is configured in [vite.config.js](vite.config.js) to match the repository name. If forking, update the `base` value accordingly.
